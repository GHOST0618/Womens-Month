    <h2>About Women's Month</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>Women's Month in South Africa, celebrated every August, honours the courage and achievements of women across the nation. It marks the 1956 march to the Union Buildings, where more than 20,000 women protested against the pass laws.</p>
        <p>It’s a reminder that women's voices matter and that equality is a right, not a privilege. Today, Women's Month is a platform to address the challenges women still face — from gender-based violence to workplace inequality — while celebrating their impact in society.</p>

    <h2>Poems for Women</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>She Walks in Strength</strong><br>
        She walks in strength, her head held high,<br>
        A flame of hope beneath the sky.<br>
        Through trials faced, she will endure,<br>
        Her voice is steady, bold, and pure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>The First Time I Saw You</strong><br>
        When I saw you,<br>
        I couldn’t believe my eyes.<br>
        Your beauty was beyond compare.<br>
        <br>
        Your skin was like porcelain<br>
        In my ceramics studio,<br>
        And your natural hair<br>
        Was like an afro of silk.<br>
        <br>
        You had the most perfect lips<br>
        I had ever seen,<br>
        And your eyes<br>
        Were like two diamonds<br>
        That spoke to my soul.<br>
        <br>
        When I saw you for the first time<br>
        I knew I would be writing<br>
        Poems about you,<br>
        There was too much goodness<br>
        That I couldn’t resist.</p>

        <p><strong>Waking Up to Thoughts of You</strong><br>
            Good morning beautiful,<br>
            How did you sleep?<br>
            <br>
            I’ve got a secret for you:<br>
            Waking up in the mornings<br>
            Is a blessing,<br>
            But waking up in the mornings<br>
            To memories and thoughts of you<br>
            Is the sweetest blessing<br>
            A man can receive.<br>
            <br>

            Thank you for bringing so much<br>
            Richness in my life<br>
            And finding daily ways<br>
            To keep a genuine smile on my face</p>

        <p><strong>She Rises</strong><br>
            In every dawn’s first tender light,<br>
            She rises, strong, embracing the fight.<br>
            Facing her fears, breaking the cage,<br>
            On life’s vast and infinite stage.<br>
            <br>
            Mountains she climbs, valleys she crosses,<br>
            Learning from gains, growing from losses.<br>
            With every step, her spirit soars high,<br>
            Reaching for dreams, touching the sky.<br>
            <br>
            She is a warrior, gentle yet fierce,<br>
            With love as her armor, adversities she pierces.<br>
            She rises, she thrives, empowered and free,<br>
            A beacon of hope, for you and for me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Rooted Yet Free</strong><br>
            Like a tree, she stands tall and proud,<br>
            Rooted deep, yet free, unbowed.<br>
            Drawing strength from earth’s embrace,<br>
            Yet reaching for the sky, in endless chase.<br>
            <br>
            Branches spread, in dance and delight,<br>
            Sheltering dreams, in day and night.<br>
            Though storms may rage, winds might blow,<br>
            She sways, but stands, in the sun’s soft glow.<br>
            <br>
            From every root, to the highest spree,<br>
            She embodies power, as vast as the sea.<br>
            Deeply anchored, yet soaring above,<br>
            She’s a symbol of strength, of undying love.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Reflected Brilliance</strong><br>
            Beneath the earth, in darkness concealed,<br>
            A diamond forms, its fate sealed.<br>
            Yet, with pressure and time’s gentle hand,<br>
            It emerges brilliant, magnificent, and grand.<br>
            <br>
            So is she, a woman of might,<br>
            Shaped by life, sparkling bright.<br>
            Facing challenges, bearing the load,<br>
            Yet shimmering with colors, in every mode.<br>
            <br>
            Each facet, a story, a journey traversed,<br>
            Of joys celebrated, of challenges cursed.<br>
            In her brilliance, empowerment reflected,<br>
            A gem of strength, revered and respected.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Oceans Within</strong><br>
            Deep as the ocean, vast and profound,<br>
            In every woman, mysteries are found.<br>
            Tides of emotion, waves of thought,<br>
            Battles endured, victories sought.<br>
            <br>
            In her depths, secrets reside,<br>
            Stories of love, of tears cried.Best gifts for your loved ones<br>
            Yet, on her surface, calmness reigns,<br>
            Grace under pressure, through all pains.<br>
            <br>
            Like the ocean, she nurtures life,<br>
            Through calm days and those of strife.<br>
            Endless depths, power untamed,<br>
            In her spirit, the universe is named.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Not Just a Dream</strong><br>
            Dreams of a world, just and fair,<br>
            Where women breathe free, without a care.<br>
            Not confined by chains or societal norms,<br>
            But free to weather life’s various storms.<br>
            <br>
            Not just a dream, but a rightful plea,<br>
            For equality, justice, and liberty.<br>
            No more shadows, no more fright,<br>
            For a world where every woman has her right.<br>
            <br>
            Silent no more, we take a stand,<br>
            Together united, hand in hand.<br>
            For dreams of justice, we’ll make them seem,<br>
            Not just a vision, but a reality’s dream.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Footsteps Forward</strong><br>
            Through ages past, footsteps trace,<br>
            The journey of women, in every space.<br>
            Some soft, some loud, but all moving forth,<br>
            Heading east, west, south, and north.<br>
            <br>
            Every step, a mark of fight,<br>
            Against injustice, towards the light.<br>
            Forward they march, come what might,<br>
            For their rights, they’ll always unite.<br>
            <br>
            Footsteps of the past, the present in view,<br>
            Together they mold a future anew.<br>
            For every stride, every move toward,<br>
            Signifies women’s rights, moving forward.</p>
